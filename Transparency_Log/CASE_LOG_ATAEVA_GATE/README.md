## 2. OPERATIONAL TIMELINE (THE SABOTAGE CYCLE)

### PHASE I: THE TRAP (Aug 2024 – May 2025)
* **The Lure:** "Special Diplomatic Channel" guaranteed.
* **The Extraction:** Solicitation of $6,000+ from beneficiary's emergency funds.
* **The Sabotage:** 8 months of "Voice-Only" delays. Zero visa applications filed.

### PHASE II: THE SILENCE (May 2025 – Oct 2025)
* **Termination:** Subject issues "Termination Memorandum" to 34 NGOs. 94% ignore it.
* **Depletion:** Family survives on proceeds from selling their Tashkent apartment (sold on AHRCA's advice), depleting life savings.

### PHASE III: THE INTERVENTION (Oct 2025)
* **System Bypass:** EU Delegation (Tashkent) bypasses AHRCA and issues direct grant (€10k).

### PHASE IV: THE HOSTAGE TRAP (Dec 2025 – Present)
* **Constructive Refoulement:** Due to resource depletion and RSF's refusal to issue support letters, the mother (63) is forced to repatriate to Uzbekistan on **Dec 14, 2025**.
* **Current Status:** She is homeless (apartment sold) and under surveillance by Uzbek security services.

## 3. FORENSIC FINDINGS

### 🚩 A. THE "DEBT TRAP" & GASLIGHTING
* **Predatory Lending:** Borrowing money from a refugee in transit.
* **The Gaslighting Loop:** Atayeva claims: *"I didn't tell you to sell the apartment."*
    * **Reality:** The family survived for 11 months *only* because of this sale, as AHRCA provided zero support.
* **Illicit Repayment:**
    * **The "Lola Scheme":** Attempting to repay debt via street cash couriers in Tashkent (Jan 2026), endangering the mother with "illegal financing" charges.

### 🗺 B. THE VISA SABOTAGE
* **Fact:** AHRCA claimed "diplomatic complexity" for 8 months.
* **Result:** Once AHRCA was removed, the Subject navigated the process independently in 3 months.
* **Conclusion:** The delay was Artificial. Goal: Asset Retention.

### 💀 C. THE HUMAN COST (HOSTAGE SITUATION)
* **Event:** Repatriation of Gulnora Abdunazarova to the zone of persecution.
* **Cause:** Financial exhaustion caused by AHRCA + Bureaucratic paralysis of RSF/FLD.
* **Outcome:** The "Protector" (AHRCA) effectively facilitated the delivery of a journalist back to the regime.
