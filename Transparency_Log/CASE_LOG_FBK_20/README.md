### 1. MISSION PARAMETERS & HYPOTHESIS

**The Objective:**
To perform a systemic stress-test of the Russian Federation's capability to interact with its diaspora. We sought to answer one primary question:
*Does the state apparatus possess a protocol for "Partnership" with independent citizens abroad, or does it default exclusively to "Suppression"?*

**The Signal Injection (The Payload):**
On the 3rd Anniversary of the SVO (Feb 24, 2025), we executed a coordinated mass-submission of legal inquiries to 24 state institutions.
* **The Content:** Notification of the launch of **"FBK 2.0" (Foundation of Bazarov: Culture)** — psychosocial support for migrants and PTSD therapy.
* **The Triggers:** We included "Memetic Hazards" (Name "FBK", Goal "Party in EU Parliament", Ideology "Feminism") to test the system's filtering logic.

### 2. FORENSIC FINDINGS: DEEP DIVE

#### 🚩 A. THE "RED FLAG" ALGORITHM (Trigger Analysis)
The audit proves the system performs **Keyword Policing**, not Semantic Analysis.

| TRIGGER | SYSTEM REACTION | INTERPRETATION |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"FBK 2.0"** | **Security Routing** | Immediate transfer to Investigative Committee. Treated as an admission of Extremism. |
| **"European Parliament"** | **Foreign Agent Flag** | Classified under Law 255-FZ as "Foreign Political Activity." |
| **"Feminism"** | **Total Erasure** | Mentioned in 16 applications. **0 responses** acknowledged the word. |

#### 🗺 B. THE VORONEZH ANOMALY (Surveillance Infrastructure)
Requests sent to the Federal Tax Service regarding a global project were rerouted to the **Voronezh Regional Directorate**, based on a passport issued there in **2019**.
* **Diagnosis:** This proves **Inter-Agency Data Sharing** between MVD and FNS. You cannot escape your "Digital Origin."

#### ⚖️ C. THE SECURITY ASSESSMENT (MinJust via SK)
Direct inquiries to the Ministry of Justice resulted in generic disclaimers. However, the inquiry sent to the **Investigative Committee (SK)** followed a hidden path and generated a response from the **"Department for Protection of National Interests from External Influence."**
* **The Content:** Not a consultation, but a **Pre-Trial Warning** citing Laws 114-FZ (Extremism) and 255-FZ (Foreign Agents).

#### 🕳 D. THE SINKHOLE TOPOLOGY (The "Catch-22")
1.  **MFA:** "Go to Fond Russkiy Mir."
2.  **Fond Russkiy Mir:** "We only fund Legal Entities."
3.  **Min. Justice:** "We do not provide consultations on how to become a Legal Entity."
4.  **Result:** **DEADLOCK.**

#### 🏢 E. THE CORPORATE VOID
The corporate sector (VTB, Yandex, VK) demonstrated **Total Paralysis** (83% Non-Response Rate). VTB Bank demanded a physical letter to the President, refusing digital processing.

### 3. FINAL VERDICT: SYSTEMIC NECROSIS & DOCTRINAL SHIFT

The audit confirms that the Russian Federation has lost the capacity for **Internal Political Interface**.

* **No Subjectivity:** The Diaspora is viewed only as a "Resource" or a "Threat".
* **Criminalization of Care:** Humanitarian aid is met with security warnings.
* **Infrastructure Determinism:** Digital surveillance overrides administrative logic.

### 🔴 CRITICAL STRATEGIC CONCLUSION

**1. THE ONTOLOGICAL SEPARATION**
The Audit proves that the **Russian Federation (State Apparatus)** and **Russian Civilization (Culture/People)** are now mutually exclusive entities. The current regime acts as an occupying force. Any real unification of the Global Russian Community must be executed **strictly outside** the jurisdiction of the RF.

**2. OPERATIONAL DECISION: SOVEREIGN STACK**
We stop asking for permission. All future infrastructure (**Centre Bazarov / GRI**) will be deployed on a **Sovereign Stack** in independent jurisdictions (France/Armenia), operating as a "State-less" entity.
