## 1. MISSION PARAMETERS
**The Objective:** To stress-test the responsiveness of the international human rights protection architecture during a verified critical incident.
**The Subject:** Miraziz Bazarov (UN-documented HRD, Ref: AL UZB 3/2021).
**The Crisis:** Arbitrary denial of entry to Georgia, loss of legal status, and financial depletion of a veteran journalist family.
**The Hypothesis:** Do mandated NGOs provide emergency aid, or do they function as bureaucratic gatekeepers?

## 2. EXECUTIVE VERDICT: THE "SYSTEM BYPASS"
This audit proves that the inefficiency of the NGO sector is **artificial**.

| METRIC | STANDARD NGO CHANNEL (RSF, FLD) | POLITICAL "SYSTEM BYPASS" (EU Direct) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Start Date** | Aug 04, 2025 | Oct 20, 2025 |
| **Process** | Bureaucratic Attrition | Direct Political Directive |
| **Duration** | **60+ Days** (Refusal) | **6 Days** (Approval) |
| **Outcome** | **0% Success** | **100% Success (€10k)** |

**Conclusion:** The resources exist. The technical capacity for rapid due diligence exists. The failure of intermediaries constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty to donors (Sida, USAID, EU).

## 3. THE OBSTRUCTION LOG (CASE STUDIES)

### 📂 EXHIBIT A: REPORTERS WITHOUT BORDERS (RSF)
**The "Fake Work" Protocol**
* **Aug 11:** Author submits comprehensive dossier (UN links, archives).
* **Sep 18:** RSF requests *the exact same links*, proving the file was unopened for 38 days.
* **Oct 02:** RSF refuses based on a hidden "6-month rule" never disclosed previously.
* **Verdict:** Administrative Sadism.

### 📂 EXHIBIT B: FRONT LINE DEFENDERS (FLD)
**The "Safety Paradox"**
* **Context:** Author is denied entry to Georgia and stranded in transit.
* **Response:** FLD refuses support claiming the applicant is *"already relocated"* and thus safe.
* **Verdict:** Gaslighting. Defining "safety" by geography while ignoring legal limbo.

### 📂 EXHIBIT C: COMMITTEE TO PROTECT JOURNALISTS (CPJ)
**Asset Hoarding**
* **Financials:** $33.1M Net Assets vs 6% Grant Distribution.
* **Action:** Refused a $5,000 survival grant while holding reserves for 2.7 years of operations.

### 📂 EXHIBIT D: SIDA (SWEDISH AGENCY)
**Gross Negligence**
* **Event:** On Aug 11, 2025, Author notified Sida that their grantee **CIVICUS** had a broken website (404 Error) and auto-replies dating back to 2023.
* **Result:** No action taken. Continued funding of a non-operational entity.
